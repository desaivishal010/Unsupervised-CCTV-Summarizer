# How to Push to GitHub

Since we're having authentication issues, here are the steps to get your code to GitHub:

## Option 1: Manual Upload (Easiest)

1. Go to your GitHub repository: https://github.com/desaivishal010/Unsupervised-CCTV-Summarizer
2. Click "uploading an existing file" or drag and drop
3. Upload all these files:
   - `.gitignore`
   - `LICENSE`
   - `README.md`
   - `requirements.txt`
   - `setup.py`
   - `src/` folder (entire folder)
   - `examples/` folder (entire folder)
   - `tests/` folder (entire folder)
   - `docs/` folder (entire folder)

## Option 2: Fix Git Authentication

### Create Personal Access Token:
1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Name: "CCTV Summarizer"
4. Select: "repo" scope
5. Click "Generate token"
6. Copy the token

### Then run these commands:
```bash
git push -u origin main
# When prompted:
# Username: desaivishal010
# Password: [paste your token here]
```

## Option 3: Use GitHub Desktop

1. Download GitHub Desktop
2. Clone your repository
3. Copy all files to the cloned folder
4. Commit and push through GitHub Desktop

## What You're Uploading

Your repository will have:
- ✅ Professional Python package structure
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation
- ✅ MIT License
- ✅ Example scripts
- ✅ Test framework
- ✅ Clean, production-ready code

This transforms your basic repository into a complete CCTV summarization system!
